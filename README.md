Scripts to speed up set up of Arch Linux in a VirtualBox VM

## Usage

- Download the Arch Linux dual ISO - https://www.archlinux.org/download/
- Create a new VM in VirtualBox
  - Open the VM settings and under `System`, check `Enable EFI (special OSes only)`
- Boot the VM from the downloaded ISO
  - This may take a couple of minutes to start and look like it hangs - **be patient**
